Need to use either a context or the App wrapper to maintain a certain amount of data. 

It would probably make sense to pull data one month at a time. 

This would mean the year view faces some difficulties. Could do a little logic to say,
if you click on a different month, await that month's data from the database.

Why not pull one day at a time?
> Month view needs information about which days have been filled in, and what their quality score &
potential big life events are. 

> Possible solution is to request only some data? But consider the format of the back end: a day object is
pulled to front end in its entirety.
